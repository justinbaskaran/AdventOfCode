# AdventOfCode
Coding Competition


https://adventofcode.com/2022


This is a coding competition where we solve questions (Christmas themed!) through code. As I am working on moving to front end web development, I have made this this repository 
to show my progress towards learning Javascript, and solving problems using JS.
